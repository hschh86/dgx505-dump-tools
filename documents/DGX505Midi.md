# DGX-505 MIDI information and other miscellany

## MIDI Implementation Chart Info
Some of this information comes from the MIDI Implementation chart
located on pages 110–113 of my multilingual copy of the DGX-505 manual
(pages 105–106 of the online English copy).
See those pages for more information, such as what is *not* recognised.

Some of this is from me experimenting with what messages are transmitted.
Also refer to the official MIDI reference tables at
https://www.midi.org/specifications/category/reference-tables.

In this document, `00` denotes hexadecimal, 00 decimal.

NOTE: According to Note 1 on pg. 113, the DGX-505 functions as a tone generator
and incoming data does not affect the panel voices/settings, with the exception
of MIDI Master Tuning and Reverb/Chorus type messages.

The state of the panel can also be affected by Local ON/OFF messages and
time control Start/Stop messages (when using External Clock).

### Channels
MIDI has 16 channels, numbered 1–16 for human consumption but 0–15 (`0`–`F`)
internally. This makes talking about them a bit confusing, so I'm going to
only use the hexadecimal notation.

Since incoming data does not affect the panel settings, we can think of
two separate sets of channels:
one set for the data coming in over the MIDI port,
and the other for the data generated by the DGX-505 itself from the keyboard
or from playback when transmitted out the MIDI port.
These two sets are entirely separate and do not affect each other (see note 1
after the chart in the manual); changing the voice using messages for channel
`0` affects the voice the DGX-505 uses when sounding incoming messages
for channel `0` but does not affect the voice used when sounding from the
keyboard directly , even though the notes from the keyboard are also sent out
using channel `0`.

It can be useful to experiment by turning LOCAL off (disabling the keyboard
from activating the tone generator directly), then connecting the DGX-505
MIDI output to its input.

When output from the DGX-505, the keyboard voices use the first three channels:
* Main voice:  `0`
* Dual voice:  `1`
* Split voice: `2`

Harmony only affects the Main voice, so the Harmony notes also use `0`.

Style output uses channels `8` and `9` for percussion, and `A`, through `F`
for accompaniment.

This leaves channels 3, 4, 5, 6, 7.
Actually I'm not sure how exactly the song playback goes. Must check that out.


### Note number
Note numbers run from 0–127 (`00`–`7F`).
The lowest key on the DGX-505, A-1, is 21 (`15`), the highest, C7, is 108
(`63`). Middle C, C3, is 60 (`3C`).
The numbers transmitted are affected by the Octave and Transpose settings,
which allows all possible notes to be played on the keyboard.
Interestingly, if the shifted notes overflow past 0 or 127, they are
transposed an octave to keep them within range (True Voice range 0–127).

### Note ON
* `9n`, velocity=1–127
* velocity=0 functions as a Note OFF.

### Note OFF
Note OFF (`8n`) messages do in fact work,
but the velocity parameter is ignored.

### Pitch Bend
Pitch bend messages are transmitted when the pitch bend wheel is used.
They are of the format `En ll mm`, where `n` is the channel, and `ll mm` are
the least and most significant 7-bit bytes respectively of the 14-bit value
with a range of 0–16383.
The neutral/unchanged value is 8192 (`2000` or `00 40`).

Consequently, Mido subtracts 8192 from the value, reporting `2000`/`00 40` as
0, with `0`/`00 00` being -8192, and `3FFF`/`7F 7F` being +8191. The formula
for converting the bytes to mido's value is (`ll` + `80`×`mm`) − `200`.

The highest the physical pitch bend wheel seems to go is +8190 in mido's
reckoning (`7E 7F`).

### Control Change messages
Control change messages have the form `Bn cc vv`, where `n` is the channel,
`cc` is the control, `vv` is the value.

### Setting the voice
The voice is set by specifying a bank and program.
These are listed for each voice in the back of the manual.
The bank is set with two control change messages (0 & 32 / `00` & `20`),
one for each byte; the program is set with a program change message `Cn`.
The voice does not change until the program is set.

Program change numbers are listed as 1–128, but the numbers in the
messages are actually 0–127 (`00`–`7F`). We all love conflicting
indexing conventions.

(note: there is an anomaly in the voice list.
On pg.100, the MIDI Program change for Steel Drums has an extra leading zero.
This can be ignored. The real value is 115,
which means 114 in the actual message, of course)

#### Bank Select
* Control 0 sets the MSB: `Bn 00 mm`
* Control 32 sets the LSB: `Bn 20 ll`

#### Program Change
`Cn pp`

For example, voice no. 153, 'Harpsichord KSP', has Bank MSB 0, LSB 1,
and program 7; to set channel `0` to this voice we use the messages
`B0 00 00` `B0 20 01` `C0 06`.

### Voice Volume
Control 7: `Bn 07 vv`

### Voice Pan
Control 10: `Bn 0A vv`

### Voice Reverb Level
Control 91: `Bn 5B vv`

### Voice Chorus Level
Control 93: `Bn 5D vv`

### Pedal Sustain
Control 64:

* value 127 on pedal down: `Bn 40 7F`
* value 0 on pedal up: `Bn 40 00`

More generally, values 63 and below act like 0, 64 and above like 127.

### Panel Sustain
Using the Panel Sustain function will emit Control 72:

* value 110 for sustain ON: `Bn 48 6E`
* value 64 for sustain OFF: `Bn 48 40`

More generally, this parameter is really the 'Release Time' according to
the chart, and can actually be set to any value 0–127:
#### Release Time
Control 72: `Bn 48 vv`

### Other Control Change Messages
These cannot be transmitted directly from the keyboard or panel, but
may be transmitted by Harmony or Song/Style playback.

#### Modulation wheel
Control 1: `Bn 01 vv`
- Makes wobbly sounds.

#### Expression
Control 11: `Bn 0B vv`

#### Portamento Control
Control 84: `Bn 54 vv`
- Honestly I'm not too sure what this does for the DGX-505, considering that
  Portamento Time and ON/OFF are apparently not supported.

#### Harmonic Content
Control 71: `Bn 47 vv`

#### Attack Time
Control 73: `Bn 49 vv`
- This is like the opposite counterpart of Release time, I think

#### Brightness
Control 74: `Bn 4A vv`

### RPN (Registed Parameter Numbers)
Used for more complicated settings, each with their own Registed Parameter
Number (represented here in the form `mm ll`). To set RPN settings, the RPN
needs to be specified using the RPN MSB/LSB messages, then the value can be
specified using the Data Entry / Increment / Decrement messages:

##### RPN MSB / LSB
* MSB set with Control 101: `Bn 65 mm`
* LSB set with Control 100: `Bn 64 ll`

##### Data Entry
* MSB set with Control 6: `Bn 06 mm`
* LSB set with Control 38: `Bn 26 ll`
  - The LSB is optional and used for really fine settings;
    I'm not sure about how exactly the LSB works when the MSB is set.

##### Data Increment / Decrement
* MSB incremented with control 96: `Bn 60 xx`
* MSB decremented with control 97: `Bn 61 xx`
  - The `xx` bytes are ignored.

#### Pitch Bend Range
Pitch Bend Range uses RPN `00 00`, with the value as MSB; LSB has no effect.

For example, a pitch bend range of 8 on channel `0` is set with the messages
`B0 65 00` `B0 64 00` `B0 06 08`.

The range in semitones can be incremented and decremented with the Data
Increment and Decrement messages.

The panel's Pitch Bend Range setting covers 1–12 for the three keyboard voices
on channels `0`, `1`, `2`; messages for the tone generator can use 0–24 and
set the range independently for each channel.

#### Channel Fine Tuning
Channel Fine Tuning uses RPN `00 01`.

According to the MIDI specs, this should change the tuning of a channel with a
resolution of 100/8192 cents, ranging from -100 to +100 cents (that is, ±1
semitone). I have no idea whether this is implemented fully for the DGX-505.
Changing the MSB definitely works, with values of `00` being a semitone lower,
`40` the default and `7F` a semitone higher; my hearing isn't good enough to
judge whether the LSB makes any difference.

#### Channel Coarse Tuning
Channel Coarse Tuning uses RPN `00 02`, value as MSB only.

This changes the tuning with a resolution of 100 cents (1 semitone); LSB has no
effect. The default value is `40`; the DGX-505 supports lowering 24 semitones to
`28` and raising 24 semitones to `58`. The value can go further than this, as
can be demonstrated using increment/decrement messages, but this has no further
effect on the tuning.

#### Null
RPN `7F 7F` is the null function number, for use when you've finished setting
parameters. It disables the data entry/modification until another RPN is
selected.

### Channel Mode Messages
The DGX-505 only supports mode 3 (OMNI OFF, POLY), so the messages that
would control the omni/poly modes if they were supported are just used for
their other function of turning sound or notes off.

#### All Sound OFF
Turns all sound on a channel off. The value `xx` is ignored.

* Control 120: `Bn 78 xx`

Alternatively, the MONO/POLY mode messages do the same thing:

* Control 126: `Bn 7E xx`
* Control 127: `Bn 7F xx`

#### All Notes OFF
Turns all notes on a channel off (i.e. as if the keys were released).
The value `xx` is ignored.

* Control 123: `Bn 7B xx`

Alternatively the OMNI mode messages do the same thing:

* Control 124: `Bn 7C xx`
* Control 125: `Bn 7D xx`

#### Reset All Controls
Control 121: `Bn 79 00`

Resets all controls on a channel to default values. Doesn't seem to affect RPN
settings.

### Other Controls
#### Local ON/OFF
Control 122:

* Local ON: `Bn 7A 7F`
* Local OFF: `Bn 7A 00`

(The channel parameter `n` is ignored.)

Like the Pedal Sustain, values 63 and below are OFF; 64 and above are ON.

Setting Local from ON to OFF also has the effect of All Sound OFF on all
channels.


### System Real Time
#### Clock
Clock messages (`F8`) are transmitted when External Clock is OFF.

#### Commands
There are two messages implemented, Start (`FA`) and Stop (`FC`).
These are transmitted at the start and end of song/style playback.
Start and Stop messages can also be received when External Clock is ON.

### Active Sense
The instrument transmits and receives Active Sensing (`FE`) messages.

### System Exclusive

#### GM System ON
`F0 7E 7F 09 01 F7`

* "Automatically restores all default settings except Master Tuning"
* Also resets the sound on all channels.

#### MIDI Master Volume
`F0 7F 7F 04 01 ll mm F7`

Changes volume of all channels
* `mm` values used, `ll` ignored.

Acts independently of channel volume.

#### MIDI Master Tuning
`F0 43 1n 27 30 00 00 mm ll cc F7`

Changes tuning of all channels. YAMAHA proprietary message.
* `mm ll` used, defaults to `08 00`. `n` and `cc` ignored.
* Only the least significant four bits of `mm` and `ll` are in fact used,
  so it's more like `F0 43 1x 27 30 00 00 xm xl xx F7`, where `x` is ignored.
  - The formula for the panel value is (`ml` − `80`), clamped to the range
    -100–+100. Inversely you can add 128 to the panel value and convert to hexadecimal to get `ml`.
  - When using the panel to adjust Tuning, messages are transmitted with all
    of the `x` in the above set to `0`.

MIDI Master Tuning acts independently of the Channel Fine/Coarse
tuning.


#### Reverb Type
`F0 43 1n 4C 02 01 00 mm ll F7`

Sets reverb type. YAMAHA proprietary message.
* `mm ll` are the MSB and LSB respectively.
* MSB types:
  * `00`, `05`–`7F`: 10(Off)
  * `01`: 01(Hall1)
  * `02`: ---(Room)
  * `03`: ---(Stage)
  * `04`: ---(Plate)
* Specific (MSB LSB) types:
  * `01 00`: 01(Hall1)
  * `01 10`: 02(Hall2)
  * `01 11`: 03(Hall3)
  * `02 11`: 04(Room1)
  * `02 13`: 05(Room2)
  * `03 10`: 06(Stage1)
  * `03 11`: 07(Stage2)
  * `04 10`: 08(Plate1)
  * `04 11`: 09(Plate2)

It appears that when an LSB corresponds to no specific type specified above,
it is as if the LSB was `00`. This means that most fall back to the generic
effects that appear as ---(Room) etc, with the exception of Hall, which
falls back to 01(Hall1).

#### Chorus Type
`F0 43 1n 4C 02 01 20 mm ll F7`

Sets chorus type. YAMAHA proprietary message.

* `mm ll` are MSB and LSB respectively
* MSB types:
  * `00`–`3F`, `44`–`7F`: 5(Off)
  * `40`: ---(Thru)
  * `41`: ---(Chorus)
  * `42`: ---(Celeste)
  * `43`: ---(Flanger)
* Specific (MSB LSB) types:
  * `42 11`: 1(Chorus1)
    - (I guess Celeste is a type of Chorus?)
  * `41 02`: 2(Chorus2)
  * `43 08`: 3(Flanger1)
  * `43 11`: 4(Flanger2)

The same LSB fallback applies.
